Stellar convection transports energy and matter inside stars. Most chemical elements in the Universe are made by stars and this process \emph{depends} on convection. Therefore, it is important to study stellar convection, which is done by making computer models. I assert that the two goals of stellar modelling is to understand and predict the properties of stars based on universal laws of physics. In this review I examine the departures from universal laws in stellar modelling. I conclude that the models do not fulfil the two goals due to limitations of both computer hardware and theory.
